# NYC Citibike Analysis 

## Purpose of Project

### The purpose of this project is to review the August 2019 data from New York City’s Citibike bike sharing program to determine whether this would be a viable business opportunity in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results

### Trip Duration

#### The majority of the bike trips were relatively short.  The bikes were utilized to get quickly from one place to the next, not long leisurely rides.  The highest number of rides were just six minutes long

### Trip Duration by Gender
![Img2](/resources/checkout_gender.png)

#### This is also true by gender.  The trips were short for both males and females.  This also highlights the high ratio of male to female ridership.

### Trips by Weekday by Hour

#### This image shows the peak times for bike usage.  On weekdays, it’s clear the bikes are being utilized heavily during the typical morning and evening commute hours.  On the weekends, they are utilized more evenly throughout the day.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

#### Again, regardless of gender, the trend remains the same.  And again, this highlights the higher usage by males.

### User Trip by Gender by Weekday

#### Subscribers are the largest ratio of users and males are the largest component of subscribers and they use the service primarily on weekdays.

### Location Use

#### The primary location of the bike starting and ending points is in the downtown area, both maps are very similar.


## Summary
### Based on the visualizations from the dataset provided, I can conclude at the bike sharing program is used mostly by subscribers, that are mostly men, that mostly take short trips (commuting to work), primarily on weekdays.  There is also a component of leisurely or tourist use, that is seen during non-peak hours as well as the weekends, but this does not appear to be the core users.

### This business model would seem to be viable in a city that doesn’t have as many tourists, such as Des Moines.  The customer base to go after is those living and working in the downtown area that would use the bikes for short commutes to work, especially males.

### One additional visualization that I would like to see is the starting and ending locations by user and day, filtered for customers and weekends only.  This would help visualize where these bikes are being used for leisure activities.
### A second additional visualization that I would like to see is bike use by age range.  This would also be helpful information in determining the potential success of this program in another city based on their population.
